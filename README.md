# Docker Capstone Project — Two-Tier Web Application

## Project Overview
As part of our Cloud Computing cohort capstone, this project demonstrates how to containerize and deploy a **two-tier web application** using **Docker** and **Docker Compose** — combining a **backend API** and a **frontend** that communicate seamlessly.

The goal is to design, build, and deploy a modern, containerized system that reflects how real-world cloud applications are structured — with clear separation between the frontend and backend, consistent networking, and easy scalability.

---

## Objectives
- Develop a **backend API** (Flask) and **frontend UI**
- Create individual **Dockerfiles** for each service
- Use **Docker Compose** to orchestrate both containers
- Push built images to **Docker Hub**
- Deploy the entire setup on a **Linux VM (Azure)**
- Optionally automate builds and deployment via **GitHub Actions CI/CD**
